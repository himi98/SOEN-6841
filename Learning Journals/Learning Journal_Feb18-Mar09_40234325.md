## Key Concepts Learned:

1. **Project Monitoring:**
   Project monitoring is all about keeping a close eye on the ins and outs of the project. It's a systematic way of tracking progress, resources, and performance metrics. This real-time oversight is crucial for making quick decisions and ensuring the project stays on the right path.

2. **Project Control Techniques:**
   Project control techniques are like the project manager's toolkit for steering the ship. Earned Value Management (EVM), Critical Path Method (CPM), and regular status reviews are some tools that help regulate activities and keep the project in line with the plan.

3. **Project Monitoring in Iterative Projects:**
   Navigating Iterative Challenges: Iterative projects, like Agile development, bring their own set of challenges. Monitoring in these scenarios means being more adaptable, with a focus on constant communication and tweaking plans based on feedback received during each iteration.

### Connecting Back to Last Week:

1. **Transition from Planning to Monitoring:**
   Moving from planning to monitoring reflects the natural flow of project management. While planning sets the stage, monitoring is like being the project's detective, making sure it's on track and ready to adapt.

2. **Considering Iterative Project Monitoring:**
   The idea of iterative project monitoring aligns with the diverse types of project plans we talked about last week. Iterative plans need a monitoring approach that's as flexible as the development process itself.

Understanding these concepts isn't just about having theoretical knowledge; it's about arming oneself with the tools and insights needed to navigate the unpredictable journey of project management effectively.

## Reflections on Case Study/course work:

- As we approach the end of Part I in our syllabus, which focuses on the primary activities in project management, I realize how crucial this foundation is for the upcoming sections on Lifecycle Management, Process Improvement, and People Management in Parts II, III, and IV, respectively. It's becoming increasingly clear that understanding software project management requires a comprehensive grasp of these essential, complementary activities.
- Reflecting on the midterm exam, which took place before the reading week, I had a chance to discuss the nature and quality of the questions with my peers. We concluded that while a few questions were somewhat perplexing, the majority were direct. On a personal note, I found the "Match the following" section to be somewhat challenging.

## Collaborative Learning:
- In the recent class, we went through the solutions for the midterm exam, engaging in a constructive dialogue with the professor and fellow classmates. This interaction served a dual purpose: firstly, it acted as a revision of previously covered topics, and secondly, it allowed me to evaluate my performance, pinpoint mistakes, and avoid repeating them in the final exam. The experience highlighted the importance of both memorization and critical thinking in tackling such exams.
- Additionally, the professor shared insights from her collaboration with a friend at Desjardins, who works as a Consultant. Their discussion emphasized the significance of software project management terminologies, such as project plan and project charter, in real-world projects at companies like Desjardins. A key takeaway was the need to memorize definitions, enhancing our understanding more effectively than relying solely on online searches.

## Further Research/Readings:
- I'm eager to get ahead by reviewing chapter 8 on project closure before our next class. This will give me a solid understanding of the upcoming discussion and allow me to see how it connects with chapter 7's content on monitoring and control, especially as these processes are essential up until the project concludes.
- In preparation for phase 2 of our project, I revisited our initial initiation and market analysis report. This review helped me bridge the gap between our completed work and the expectations for this phase. Furthermore, I've been researching online about different feasibility studies that we need to include in our report and plan to further explore how to effectively present these studies through figures, graphs, or tables.

## Adjustments to Goals:
- I'm pleased with the goals I've achieved so far, and I find the progress I've made to be personally rewarding.
- In the coming week, my focus will be on collaborating with my project group to tackle the section of our project dedicated to the feasibility study. I've already looked into the critical role that feasibility studies play in projects, especially those concerning the development of financial literacy applications.
- Additionally, I'm gearing up to dive into our topic analysis task. We've selected "Transparency Takes More Than an Open Door" as our theme, which, although abstract, sparks great interest in me. My plan is to scour for compelling resources on the subject and begin crafting an engaging presentation.
