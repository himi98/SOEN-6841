**Course:** SOEN 6841 Software Project Management (Winter 2024)

**Week 2:** Jan 28, 2024 -- Feb 03, 2024

**Date:** Feb 03, 2024


**Key Concepts Learned:**

- Effort Estimate:

o Effort estimation focuses on the amount of work involved, often measured in person-hours or person-days.

o Reliance on expert judgment, historical data, and mathematical models for accurate predictions.

- Cost Estimate:

o Cost estimation involves determining the financial resources required for project execution.

o Different roles of detailed bottom-up estimates, analogous comparisons, and parametric modeling in cost estimation.

- Schedule Estimate:

o Schedule estimation revolves around predicting the time needed for project completion.

o Signifies expert judgment, analogous estimation, and three-point estimation for realistic schedule predictions.

- Resource Estimate:

o Resource estimation entails identifying and quantifying the human and material resources necessary for project tasks.

o The important components in resource planning are expert input, detailed bottom-up assessments, and analogous comparisons.

- Risk Definition:

o A project risk is an uncertain event that can influence project outcomes positively or negatively.

- Types of Risks:

o There exists a diverse nature of risks, ranging from project-specific issues to external factors and technological challenges.

- Impact of Risks:

o The risks can have both negative and positive consequences, affecting project schedule, cost, and quality.

- Risk Mitigation Strategies:

o Some important components in managing and responding to risks are proactive strategies, including avoidance, transfer, mitigation, and acceptance.


**Application in Real Projects:**

- Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Implementation:

o Cost and Effort Estimation: Estimating the financial and human resources required for implementing an ERP system, including software customization, data migration, and training efforts.

o Risk Management: Identifying risks such as data integrity issues, resistance to change among users, or system integration challenges and developing mitigation plans.

- Mobile App Development:

o Cost and Effort Estimation: Estimating the development costs, effort, and time required to create a mobile application, considering factors like platform compatibility, feature complexity, and design requirements.

o Risk Management: Addressing risks related to changing mobile device specifications, evolving operating systems, and potential security vulnerabilities in the app.

- E-commerce Platform Upgrade:

o Cost and Effort Estimation: Estimating the costs and effort needed for upgrading an existing e-commerce platform, including database migrations, front-end enhancements, and integration with new payment gateways.

o Risk Management: Identifying risks associated with potential disruptions to online transactions, user experience issues during the upgrade, and data migration challenges.


**Peer Interactions:**

- I interacted with my project teammates in the last class and we exchanged introductions to get to know each other better.

- Also, we had an online project group meeting to start working on the project. By interacting with my project peers, we brainstormed and managed to come up with a strategy to start with the project.
  

**Challenges Faced:**

- The concepts were quite straightforward to read and understand.

- An initial challenge related to a clear understanding of the project topic and objective. I cleared it by reaching out to Professor Joumana in person in the last class.
  

**Personal development activities:**

- I participated in one of the CAPS workshops on "Consulting in Management" addressed by panels from leading consulting companies like Accenture, and Deloitte. By attending the workshop, I gained an insight on how Software Engineers can use their technical knowledge and prepare themselves to enter into the world of Management Consulting.
  

**Goals for the Next Week:**

- Read chapters to be covered in class before the actual lecture. I already read Ch5 to be covered in the upcoming lecture.

- I am planning to start researching the "ScrumMaster Alliance" Certification and soon start preparing for the certification exam.

- Continue working on the project work and make some significant progress. Planning to do a market analysis of the domain (Financial Literacy) assigned for the project.
